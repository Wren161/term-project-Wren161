# GAHT

"This is version 1.1 of the GAHT provider database. It contains only the
name of facility, street address, city, state, ZIP code and lat/long of
each facility. It's vector data (points) in GeoJSON format and can be
added directly to a GIS (like QGIS, GeoDa, or the ESRI suite). By
default it is not projected because it can be disaggregated by state to
measure local availability. It's designed for research purposes first
and foremost and was not designed to be user-facing or as a tool for
trans people seeking GAHT to find care providers.`<br>`{=html}These data
are pulled from existing sources, which are linked below, as well as
from web searches and snowballing. Data were collected between Fall 2019
and Spring 2021 and have not been updated
since.`<br>`{=html}`<BR>`{=html}PLEASE NOTE:`<br>`{=html}Inclusion in
the database is not an endorsement of services provided; rather,
inclusion is merely an acknowledgement that GAHT is provided by one or
more providers at a given facility according to publicly available
information.`<br>`{=html}`<br>`{=html} Sources:`<br>`{=html}
